## Forked so I can change the "Done for today" to make it show the next event in calendar even if it's not on the same date
original developer: https://github.com/artisticat1/gnome-next-up

## To-do
- [ ] Have it show next event this week, only until Sunday
- [ ] Be able to select the preferences i'm adding on the dropdown menu
